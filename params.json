  "body": "# Introduction\r\nIn **[slack](https://slack.com/)** world, everyone can generate own **bot** service.  \r\nAnd here is the **[Sparki](http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/)**(powered by [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)). [Sparki](http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/) is a robot.  \r\n\r\nLet's combine the services. You can control [Sparki](http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/) from [slack](https://slack.com/).  \r\nOn this project, i made him a Coffee delivery robot.  \r\nHe gets all your orders, responds to your questions and deliver a coffee to your place, gently.\r\n\r\n# It's working\r\n1. New order comes from my boss! Sparki responds.  \r\n  TODO: Movie  \r\n2. Sparki arrived at a pot, and calls me. I cook a coffee and give him.  \r\n  TODO: Movie  \r\n3. Now Sparki is delivering a coffee to my boss. I hope my boss is patient...  \r\n  TODO: Movie\r\n4. My boss seems to be inpatient... He asked Sparki what he's doing right now.  \r\n  TODO: Movie\r\n5. Phew! It was long way! Here is your coffee. I'm going to back home. Bye!  \r\n  TODO: Movie\r\n6. I arrived at home now. Waiting next order.  \r\n  TODO: Movie\r\n\r\n# Ingredients\r\n* [Sparki](http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/)\r\n  * Five Infrared sensors for line following\r\n  * Ultrasonic sensor for detecting whether robot has a coffee\r\n  * Beep for notifying that robot reaches each terminals.\r\n  * Sparki arms for hodling a coffee cup\r\n  * Serial Communication via Bluetooth\r\n* [slack](https://slack.com/)\r\n  * [Bot Service](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)\r\n* Node.js Server (Mac OS X)\r\n  * Serial Communication via Bluetooth\r\n  * Kicking Slack Bot API\r\n  * State management/Control for Sparki\r\n\r\n# Recipe\r\n1. Create a sample project that Sparki and Node.js can communicate via Bluetooth.  \r\n2. Create a sample project that slack and Node.js can communicate via slack API.  \r\n3. Mix 1. and 2.  \r\n**You can download all sources from [here](https://github.com/dosuken123/CoffeeServeRobot).**  \r\n\r\n# References\r\nTODO: from dev memo",
