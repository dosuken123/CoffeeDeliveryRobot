DONE: Research Arduino vs Raspberry Pi vs SmartPhone
        DONE: dsp
                -> Possible, but not ideal for real time. (You should go with dedicated DSP Board)
        DONE: Available Input, Sensors
                -> Camera, Bluetooth, Bluetooth, Microphone input, stereo audio output, WiFi, RTC, IR receiver, SATA, temperature sensor, temperature sensor, humidity, LCD Display, Motion Sensor, Gas detectors, Bottons,
                http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/supported-sensors/
        DONE: Recipes
                Game, Security, Robot, Music, Wifi, Kick API, Farm bot

Arduino: Simple
Raspberry Pi: Complex

        You should choose Arduino if:
        You are from electronics background or if you are a beginner and really want to learn about electronics and its components.
        Your project is simple, especially networking is not involved.
        Your project is more like a electronics project where software applications are not involved, like Burglar alarm, voice controlled light.
        You are not a computer geek who is not much interested in softwares and Linux.
         
        You should choose Raspberry Pi If:
        Your project is complex and networking is involved.
        Your project is more like a software application, like a VPN server or Webserver
        Donâ€™t have good knowledge of electronics.
        Have good knowledge about Linux and softwares.

By the way,
Visualization is for designer's filed.
You may be ought to focus on your major(Sound).

Input(Sound) -> Output(Visualization) e.g. Visualizer
Input(Sound) -> Modulation(Sensor) -> Output(Sound) e.g. DSP effector
Input(Sensor) -> Output(Sound) e.g. Keyboard

Auto Sync looper. 
Looper's issue -> If you user looper in a band, Looper will be the conductor, but others.
                  It dominates every thing. 
                  How can i avoid it.
